# EASP – Efficient Automated Service Provider 🌐📱
Final Year Project | MERN Stack | Freelance Services Platform

EASP is a MERN stack-based web platform inspired by Fiverr, designed specifically for physical service providers like electricians, plumbers, tutors, and more. Built as a university Final Year Project, the goal was to make finding and offering local services more efficient and connected.
